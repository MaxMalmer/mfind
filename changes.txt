What has changed since the last version of the code:

- getopt has been replaced with getopt_long for better commandline formatting.
- The commandline is now parsed not backwards and options are instead taken into
  consideration to arguments.
- Error handling has been added to all relevant system calls.
- Comments has been updated.
- Code is again tested with Helgrind and Valgrind.
